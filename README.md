# ECCS1611
Dominic Hupp's Ohio Northern ECCS1611 Repository. 
This repository will serve as Dominic's Programming 1 Github Repo for ECCS1611 at Ohio Northern University with Dr. Stephany.
The class is C++ based and this will be reflected in the code & documentation listed here

---

# Contents
## HelloWorld
This folder contains a simple hello world program in C++ that was created to initialize this repo from the first day of class

## Labs
This folder contains all of my raw lab submission files
#### Lab One
> Contains the first lab we did in this class, most of the code was provided and I was required to fix the calculations as well as forcing uppercase from C/F
#### Prelab Two (01)
> Required me to write a few small demo programs to release the lab early
#### Lab Two
> Required me to get a username from cin, sum up the first five numbers starting at one, and creating the product of the first five numbers starting at one
#### Prelab Three (02)
> Used math operators and cin to calculate the cost of fencing for rails & posts
#### Lab Three
> Used math operators to solve various math functions, calculated the total cost of owning a car, and calculated shipping costs for a bookstore
#### Prelab 03
> Determined the tax rate with rounding code needed for MP1
#### Lab Four
> Determined matter state of water at a given temp, find the largest number of 3 doubles, get digits in integer, and calculate change needed
#### Prelab 04
> Determined how to check if a credit card number is valid
#### Lab Five
> Used loops to calculate max/min/avg, combined loops with math operations, and convert base 10 to base 2
#### Prelab 05
> Practiced using iteration to achieve various results
#### Lab Six
> Used loops to calculate count/avg/std, and print out diamonds of variable size lengths
#### Lab Seven
> Used functions to iterate through various number tasks such as calculating average, first digit, last digit, etc
#### Lab Eight
> Calculated the number of vowels in strings, words in strings, and converted roman numerals to decimal values


## PracticeProblems
This folder contains in class & book practice problems
#### InClass8.21.20
> This assignment contains six various practice problems involving cin/cout statements, string mutation, and mod.
#### InClass8.28.20
> This assignment contains six various practice problems involving if statements and string manipulation.

## ExtraCredit
This folder contains all the extra credit assignments that were assigned
#### BirthdayInput
> Using provided code, I had to solve some intentional error from lecture on Wednesday, August 19th, 2020. This required me to understand .substr(), cin/getline, and I also chose to write a small function to strip out whitespace.

## MPs
This folder contains the solutions and test cases for the major programming projects for this class
#### MP1
> I had to design a system to calculate the cost of donuts and provide the store with the proper amount of change to return to the customer. This project was all encompassing for the first 1/3 of the semester
#### MP2
> Design a simulation of the dice game 'Roll em Pigs' that allows for a human to play against the computer
#### MP3
> Design a player versus player version of tic-tac-toe that can play multiple games and track scores across games
